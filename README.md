while in transportation my computer's SSD was damaged so it was replaced and I had to start over from the last commit. I now understand the importance of saving frequently.

I ran the model overnight. Training accuraccy seems to be going up considtently but the validation accuracy is all over the place. I am going to up the batch size from 8 to 16 or 32 if needed and see if this improves things.
